	I want to change three things as far as me is concerned: these are 
	1) Descipline
	2) Team Work
	3) persistency

 I want to change my mind set in these nine upcoming days which is specifically september 9
 I don't wanna be known as before;I want to see myself changed a lot 

In A2SV in these upcoming nine days I want to invest those changes and the qualities which I had before
For Micro-Yelp I want to see this project done by the hands of me and my colleagues with much brave and courage as well as without any ashameness.However,this can not be achieved through
words but with much effort and dedication.

At last but not the least if you ask me what I want and must do and achieve before you leave A2SV; 
	I want to pour out my potential to make 
	me better communicator,team worker
	and I want every A2SVians and AAiT students to think every thing is possible as soon as they think of me.
